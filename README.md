# Project Overview
Agora is a mobile marketplace application designed to facilitate secure and seamless buying, selling, renting, and exchanging of items and services exclusively within college communities and nearby universities. It aims to enhance campus life by providing a trusted platform for students to connect, trade, and offer services to their peers.

# Key Features (MVP)
- User Management: Secure student registration (via college email/ID verification), login, role-based access (Student/Admin), and comprehensive profile management (including profile pictures).

- Item & Service Listings: Sellers can post detailed listings for physical items (books, electronics, furniture, clothes) or services (tutoring, assignment help), complete with multiple images, descriptions, categories, conditions, prices/exchange details, and availability options.

- Discovery & Search: Buyers can browse, search by keywords, filter by category, price range, condition, and college, and sort listings by various criteria (newest, price).

- In-App Chat System: Direct messaging between buyers and sellers, contextually linked to specific listings, enabling negotiation and an integrated offer system.

- Safety & Moderation: Users can report suspicious listings or users, with an admin panel for reviewing reports and taking necessary actions (e.g., deactivating listings, banning users).

# Technology Stack
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java)

- Database: PostgreSQL (Dockerized for easy setup)

- Image Storage: Cloudinary (for efficient image upload, transformation, and delivery)

- Mobile Frontend: React Native (Cross-platform iOS & Android development)

# Vision
To create a vibrant, safe, and efficient peer-to-peer marketplace that empowers college students to easily exchange goods and services, fostering a more connected and sustainable campus environment.
